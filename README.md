# Dinah---Stocks-Analysis

2nd Project on Boot Camp Exercise for Data Analystics


## Purpose

###	Deliverable 1: Refactor VBA code and measure performance

This deliverable will include an updated workbook and a folder with PNGs of the pop-ups with script run time

In this challenge, you’ll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written analysis that explains your findings.
Download the challenge_starter_code.vbs file and rename it VBA_Challenge.vbs.
Create a folder called “Resources” to hold the run-time pop-up messages that you’ll screenshot after running refactored analyses for 2017 and 2018.
Rename the green_stocks.xlsm file that you used in this module as VBA_Challenge.xlsm.
Add the VBA_Challenge.vbs script to the Microsoft Visual Basic editor.
Use the steps below to add code where indicated by the numbered comments in the starter code file.


###	Deliverable 2: A written analysis of your results (README.md)

Deliverable 1 Requirements
You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 1 by completing all requirements below:

The tickerIndex is set equal to zero before looping over the rows. (5 pt).
Arrays are created for tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices (15 pt).
The tickerIndex is used to access the stock ticker index for the tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices arrays (15 pt).
The script loops through stock data, reading and storing all of the following values from each row: tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices (25 pt).
Code for formatting the cells in the spreadsheet is working (5 pt).
There are comments to explain the purpose of the code (5 pt).
The outputs for the 2017 and 2018 stock analyses in the VBA_Challenge.xlsm workbook match the outputs from the AllStockAnalysis in the module (5 pt).
The pop-up messages showing the elapsed run time for the script are saved as VBA_Challenge_2017.png and VBA_Challenge_2018.png (5 pt).
Deliverable 2: Written Analysis of Results (20 points)
Deliverable 2 Instructions
Initialize your repository with a README, and write your analysis of Deliverable 1.


## Analysis and Challenges

This documentation (Links to an external site.) provides more information about basic writing and formatting syntax for GitHub.

For your written analysis, be sure to use complete and coherent sentences. Your written analysis should contain three sections, which cover the following:


### Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
Deliverable 2 Requirements
